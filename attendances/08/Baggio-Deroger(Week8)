Today, since there was no meeting with the teacher we continued our to study the material from where we left off last week, continuing the flutter jobsheet.
On flutter, we have learned about statefull, controller, property, layouting and when to use decoration on our app.

A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data. Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField are examples of stateful widgets. Stateful widgets subclass StatefulWidget.

Add the layout widget to the page
on lib/main.dart (MyApp):
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter layout demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Flutter layout demo'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
