In today's class, we were asked to learn about the material on listview and recyclerview. In this summary, I am going to give an overview of what we have studied so far.
The RecyclerView is a new ViewGroup that is prepared to render any adapter-based view in a similar way. It is supossed to be the successor of ListView and GridView, 
and it can be found in the latest support-v7 version. The RecyclerView has been developed with extensibility in mindto enable users to create any kind of layout, that being said
it comes with its cons since it is more complicated.
Advantages of RecyclerView over listview :

. Contains ViewHolder by default.

. Easy animations.

. Supports horizontal , grid and staggered layouts

Advantages of listView over recyclerView :

. Easy to add divider.

. Can use inbuilt arrayAdapter for simple plain lists

. Supports Header and footer .

. Supports OnItemClickListner .
